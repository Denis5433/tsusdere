## Hi there <img src="https://codingnbb.com/images/wavehand.gif" width="25px">
I am currently a Graphics Software Engineer at [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html). Where I work with the validation team in pre-silicon for GFX IP models using Python, Perl, SQL, and Splunk. 

I currently attend [The Univeristy of Texas at Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/) where I am persuing my M.S. in Computer science with a focus in Machine Learning. Prior, to that I received my B.S. in Computer Science from [The University of Texas at San Antonio](https://cs.utsa.edu/) where I worked as a CS & Math tutor.
When I am not programming I like to build [Gunpla](https://www.usagundamstore.com/) models as well as go to the gym!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning MERN stack for web development and practice problems in LeetCode.

## Projects
I have experience working with ML and DL libraries such as Skickit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV just to name a few. 

 âš¡ Noteable Projects:
  - [Generating Anime](https://github.com/tsusdere/Generating-Anime)
        
    - Developed a GAN model to generate anime faces from a noise vector.
  - [Colorize The Past](https://github.com/tsusdere/Colorize_The_past)
    - Implemented a CNN to colorize Black and White images
  - [AI FLappy Bird](https://github.com/tsusdere/AIFlappyBird)
    - Used the NEAT algorithm to develop an agent that learns to play Flappy Bird
  
  There are other projects I am proud of such as building an Interpreter in Java as well as developing a 2D-RPG game in Unity, as most say
  you learn by doing.
